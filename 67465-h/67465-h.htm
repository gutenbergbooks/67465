<p>Poultry farming as a means of profit can
be made successful only by maintaining the
most vigorous and sustained campaign
against disease. The aim of the poultry
rearer should be to stamp out disease by
preventive measures. Practical experience
proves the inefficiency of many so-called
cures, and points to the urgency of poultrymen
endeavoring to understand more thoroughly
the causes of the ailments to which
domestic fowls are liable.</p>

<p>My aim is to put a concise handbook into
the hands of poultry rearers, who should
thus be assisted in determining the various
diseases and in taking the precautionary
steps important in preventing the introduction
and spread of contagious diseases. No
effort is made to elaborate the scientific side
of the subject. Those desirous of obtaining
full information about the types of
organisms that have been proved to be the
specific causes of, or to be invariably asso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>ciated
with, particular disorders, may do so
with profit by obtaining fuller works on the
subject. Many scientific workers are devoting
their time to the problem of combating
diseases among poultry, and assistance
is willingly given by officers of the experiment
stations to farmers who desire to
identify any disease causing loss in their
flocks.</p>

<p>The practical poultryman will recognize
the fact that measures for the control of
disease cannot be limited to sanitation
and the treatment of sick birds, but, in
reality, include such important matters as
the selection of healthy stock, intelligent
feeding, proper housing, and other details
essential to the successful management of
poultry.</p>

<p>I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness
to the works of Dr. D. E. Salmon and
John H. Robinson, editor of Farm Poultry,
and to the recent publication on poultry diseases
by Dr. Raymond Pearl, Frank M.
Surface, and Maynie R. Curtis. My thanks
are due to R. S. Martinez for the care taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
in making the photographs from which the
drawings for the illustrations in the chapter
on Post-Mortem Examinations were prepared.
Much valuable information has
also been obtained from bulletins issued by
the experiment stations of the United States
and by the Ontario Agricultural College of
Canada.</p>

Disease</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p><i>1. Importance of Controlling Disease</i></p>

<p>The ravages of disease add considerably
to the difficulties of raising poultry in
all parts of the world. It is the experience
of poultry rearers that an annual toll has to
be paid in the lives of young birds and older
stock. Sooner or later, in addition, an epidemic
may break out and result in heavy
losses and much discouragement.</p>

<p>It is most important, therefore, to be able
to recognize the symptoms and to know the
causes of the many diseases to which various
kinds of poultry are subject. Every
practical effort should be made to reduce
avoidable mortality. An unexplained
death should be regarded with concern. It
may point to the presence of a serious disease.
When there is not sufficient external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
evidence for determining the cause of death,
a post-mortem examination should be made
(see page <a href="#Page_98">98</a>).</p>

<p>The poultryman must know above all
whether he is dealing with an infectious disease
or not. The discovery that a sudden
death among his fowls is due to apoplexy
will set his mind at ease. On the other hand,
if a case of cholera occurs, the body of the
dead fowl should be burnt, and a vigorous
campaign started to prevent the spread of
the disease; birds showing mopishness and
other suspicious symptoms should be
isolated; the houses, the feed troughs, the
water vessels, and the yard to which the dead
fowl has had access, should all be thoroughly
disinfected.</p>


<p><i>2. Dangers of Introducing Disease</i></p>

<p>Perhaps more loss has been caused by introducing
birds with disease into a healthy
flock than by any other means. Readers
will, doubtless, be able to recall occasions
on which their own, or their neighbors’,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
flocks suffered. An instance was recently
related to the writer. A poultryman was
offered two fowls, which he at first refused,
but owing to the vagrant seller’s importunity,
he eventually bought the birds and let
them loose among the home flock. On the
following day one died; but no effort was
made to discover the cause, nor was the dead
fowl’s body burnt. In a few days, a fowl
belonging to the original flock died and, in
three to four weeks after the purchase, two-thirds
of the stock had died. It afterwards
transpired that the vendor had lost several
of his fowls from cholera, and the fear of
further mortalities had been his reason
for being so anxious to dispose of the
survivors.</p>

<p>On every farm where poultry is kept,
there should be a quarantine ward for new
purchases. The most careful breeders will
isolate their own birds that have returned
from an exhibition, for fear they may have
contracted some disease there or on the
journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>


<p><i>3. Control Measures</i></p>

<p>Practical experience and scientific investigation
have clearly proved that preventive
measures are more economical and
effective than curative. Failing prevention,
everything points to the importance of
dealing promptly with the first cases, owing
to the risk of infection of the rest of the
stock. Control measures may be divided
into three classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Proper housing and feeding of fowls.</p>

<p>2. General sanitation and disinfection.</p>

<p>3. Administration of medicine to sick birds.</p>
</div>

<p>The details to which special attention
must be given are covered by the following
axiomatic rules:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Isolate birds recently purchased—for two or three weeks.</p>

<p>2. Isolate every bird that shows any sign of ill health.</p>

<p>3. Provide a fresh and pure supply of water in a shady
position.</p>

<p>4. Add Epsom salts (one teaspoonful to a quart) once a
week to the drinking water. Give chickens daily a
liberal supply of bran in addition to their other food.</p>

<p>5. Feed birds on a varied diet, including green food.</p>

<p>6. Arrange that birds have to scratch for some of their food.</p>

<p>7. Construct houses, nest boxes, etc., so that they can be
readily and thoroughly disinfected. Houses should
be free from drafts.</p>

<p>8. Disinfect contaminated soil by spraying, liming, and
resting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>9. Visit the roosts at night to detect cases of wheezing due
to colds, and to search for mites and other pests.</p>

<p>10. Keep on hand disinfectants, lice powders and medicines
likely to be required.</p>
</div>


<p><i>4. Nursing Sick Birds</i></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i016" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i016.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—ISOLATION</div>
</div>

<p>The small margin of profit on a single
fowl makes dosing with medicines and nursing
an unprofitable occupation, except in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
the case of valuable stock. If the treatment
of a bird is undertaken, it should be borne
in mind that more depends upon attention
to the rules of good nursing than to the
administration of drugs. Comfortable
quarters, warm and free from drafts, clean
straw, and invalid’s diet of soft and easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
digested food will all turn the chances in
favor of recovery.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i017" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i017.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>—DESOLATION</div>
</div>

<p>Too often isolation is in effect a death sentence.
The bird is put into cramped quarters,
exposed to cold winds and beating
rains, and, being in an out-of-the-way corner,
is, perhaps, neglected instead of being
specially cared for.</p>

<p>Fowls that will not take food should be
fed lightly, but frequently, with a spoon in
order that their strength may be kept up.
All stale food should be removed.</p>


<p><i>5. The Use of Drugs and Medicines</i></p>

<p>Drugs and medicines likely to be required
should always be kept in stock. The
weekly use of Epsom salts, as a mild laxative
for preventing intestinal disorders, is
strongly recommended. Little faith should
be put in drugs said to cure tuberculosis,
cholera, etc. Below is given a list of the
medicines generally required. The doses
given in the table are for a medium-sized
adult fowl; three-quarters as much should
be given for a half-grown bird, and about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
one-fifth for a young chicken. Treatment
should be repeated as necessary, and animals
should be well nursed.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>—HOW DISEASE IS SPREAD<br />
Germs of tuberculosis in the excrement of a fowl. (After Edwards.)</div>
</div>


<p>The important part played by micro-organisms
in causing and spreading disease
must be understood before the value of disinfection
can be fully appreciated. The
poultryman must develop a sense of sight
that sees lurking microbes at every turn,
especially in unclean corners. Figure 5
shows germs revealed by the microscope in
the excrement of a bird suffering from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
tuberculosis. The fact that this speck contained
so many germs, although it was far
too small to be seen with the naked eye, will
give an idea of how epidemics may be
caused by food, water, and soil contaminated
by excreta, nasal discharges, etc.</p>

<p>Regular and thorough disinfection of
woodwork, of feeding vessels, and of the
drinking water should form part of the
routine of poultry management, and a stock
of disinfectants should always be kept on
hand. It will be found convenient to have
an iron drum with a tap for a diluted solution,
say 5%, of some standard disinfectant—e. g.,
creolin—that can be further diluted
as required.</p>

<p><i>Water.</i> A stock solution of permanganate
of potash, made by adding ten grains
to one quart of water, should always be kept
on hand for purposes of disinfection. When
there is danger of infection, two tablespoonfuls
of this solution should be added to
every gallon of drinking water.</p>

<p><i>Feeding Vessels.</i> Clean with boiling
water.</p>

whitewash should be prepared with quick-lime.
The house should first be cleaned
out with an iron scraper and scrubbing
brush, using a liberal supply of water (see
Fig. <a href="#i023">6</a>).</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i> The most convenient of the following
methods should be adopted:</p>

<p>(1) Spray surface with 5% creolin.</p>

<p>(2) Spread straw over ground and set
fire to it.</p>

<p>(3) Fork over and lime. This method
is not sufficient if serious contamination is
suspected.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Diseases of Poultry Other Than Fowls</span></small></h2>
</div>

<p>All classes of domestic poultry are to
a great extent subject to the same diseases
that affect the common fowl. The
symptoms of such diseases are for the most
part similar to those noticed when fowls are
affected, and treatment must be on the same
lines. In the management of turkeys,
ducks, geese, guinea fowls and pigeons, the
strictest sanitary measures must be enforced,
as in the rearing of fowls.</p>

<p>Owing to its importance, blackhead of
turkeys is dealt with separately. It is one
of the most serious of poultry diseases and
causes heavy losses to turkey rearers. Careful
study should be made of the reports of
the recent investigations at the Rhode Island
Experiment Station.</p>

<p>Severe epidemics of diarrhea or cholera
occur among all classes of poultry. Geese
are subject to a form of cholera that appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to be different from any kind that attacks
fowls. Water fowl are not commonly infested
with external parasites. Pigeons, on
the other hand, are worried by fleas and
ticks as well as mites. Smallpox of pigeons
is similar to chicken pox of fowls, but pustular
swellings may be found on the rump
and the cloaca of the pigeon as well as on the
head. The scaly leg mite attacks turkeys
and the gape worm is sometimes a serious
pest of poults. Below is given a list of
some of the diseases of turkeys, ducks, geese,
guinea fowls and pigeons:</p>

<h3>ABSCESSES<br />

<small><i>Not a common poultry complaint</i></small>
</h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The flesh becomes inflamed
and swollen and forms a “head” containing
pus.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A scratch or a small injury followed
by inflammation due to pus-forming
organisms.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Lance the abscess when
“ripe” with a clean, sharp knife, cutting low
so that the sore may drain readily. Squeeze
out the pus; wash with 1% carbolic acid or
creolin and dress with creolin and sweet oil
(half and half) until healed.</p>

<p>The most common abscess is that which
forms on the pad of the foot and develops
into bumblefoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>


<h3>ANÆMIA, OR GOING LIGHT<br />

<small><i>A condition that should incite the poultryman to investigate
the cause</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Birds lose weight, or ”go
light,” without any apparent reason.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A general lack of thriftiness in
the flock may be due to insufficient or poor
food, to lack of exercise, or to bad ventilation
of houses; lice or mites may be infesting the
birds. On the other hand, birds may gradually
lose weight as the result of some such
disease as tuberculosis (see page 90}, aspergillosis
(see page 29), or worms (see
page 94).</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Make any changes in feeding
or management that may appear desirable.
Search at night for mites or lice on
the birds; in the daytime examine the
straw in nest boxes, the roosts, and the
cracks and crevices of the woodwork for
parasites. Much time may often be saved
in discovering what is wrong with the flock
by killing one or more of the affected birds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
and making a post-mortem examination to
discover if a specific disease is the cause.</p>


<h3>APOPLEXY<br />

<small><i>Not a common trouble</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Staggering gait and bewildered
appearance; bird generally drops
dead suddenly.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Attributed to high feeding or
over-laying.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> There is usually no time for
treatment, but if the attack is mild, put the
bird in a dark place and give no food for a
few hours; give a dose of Epsom salts and
add green food to diet. Bleeding from
under a wing is sometimes tried.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem examination</i> shows clotted
blood on the brain, the other organs being
normal.</p>

<p>The name vertigo is applied to congestion
of the brain as distinct from apoplexy due
to hemorrhage of the brain. The fowl has
fits. It is difficult to distinguish this disease
from epilepsy (see page 55). The cause
is little understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>


<h3>ASPERGILLOSIS<br />

<small><i>A disease that exists more commonly than is usually suspected,
and is the cause of the death of large numbers of
young chickens</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Fowls gradually lose weight,
mope, and die without any pronounced ailment
except difficulty in breathing. In
adults the disease may be mistaken for
tuberculosis and in chickens for white
diarrhea. Aspergillosis of chickens is dealt
with under brooder pneumonia. Post-mortem
symptoms are whitish
or yellowish growths on the
windpipe, that can only be
definitely diagnosed under
the microscope.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A fungoid growth
in the windpipe and bronchial
tubes, sometimes extending
to the lungs and
liver. Fig. 8 shows the
spores and filaments of the
species of aspergillosis
most commonly responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
for this disease. Infection may be due to
musty grain or dirty straw.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> No medicines are of any
avail. Protection lies in not using musty
grain or moldy litter. Burn dead birds.</p>


<h3>BLACKHEAD OF TURKEYS<br />

<small><i>A very serious disease, making the successful rearing of
turkeys difficult and in some cases impossible</i>.</small>
</h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Young turkeys, or poults,
are most commonly attacked; there is loss
of weight and loss of appetite; the bird
appears listless and stands by itself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
drooping wings and tail. Diarrhea is generally
one of the symptoms. The comb
often turns a dark purple—a symptom that
has given rise to the name blackhead.
Death generally follows an attack fairly
rapidly, but in some cases the disease may
take a chronic form, while it is believed
that recovery is occasionally effected.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem symptoms.</i> The cæca (see
Fig. 32) are enlarged, are diseased in parts,
and are more or less plugged with cheesy
matter and pus. The liver is diseased,
being sometimes very much enlarged and
covered with yellowish necrotic areas, generally
depressed in the centre (see Fig. 24<i>d</i>).
In cases of an acute attack, especially in
young birds, one of the cæca only may be
affected and the liver may not be invaded.
The extent of the necrotic areas and the
degree of the enlargement of the infected
organs may vary greatly in different cases.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The cause of blackhead has been
shown by Drs. Cole and Hadley to be a
coccidium. A full account of their work
is published in Bulletin 141 of the Rhode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Island Experiment Station. Coccidia enter
the digestive tract of the healthy turkey by
means of food or water infected by the
excrement of a sick bird. The organisms
pass along the alimentary canal until they
reach the cæca, the lining of which they
attack, giving rise to the conditions mentioned
under post-mortem symptoms. How
the infection spreads from the cæca to the
liver is not clear.</p>

<p>It has been conclusively proved that
fowls, as well as pigeons, sparrows, etc., act
as hosts for these parasites. Although
adult fowls have a great degree of resistance
themselves, they are a means of carrying
infection to turkeys.</p>

<p>Eggs may be one of the means of spreading
the disease, as they may become contaminated
in the oviduct or the cloaca of
birds affected with blackhead.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> No remedy or satisfactory
method of prevention has been discovered.
The difficulty of effecting a cure is obvious
when the nature of the disease is con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>sidered.
Drs. Cole and Hadley summarize
measures of prevention as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Protect the yards and flocks which may have the good
fortune to be uninfected with the blackhead organism by a
thorough examination of all new stock, whether turkeys,
fowls, geese or other domestic birds.</p>

<p>2. Keep the turkeys on grounds which are as fresh as
can be obtained, and above all, keep them isolated from
fowls and other domestic birds.</p>

<p>3. Keep every turkey in the flock under close observation
in order to separate and at once isolate any bird which
gives evidence of the disease. To facilitate such observations
it is helpful to leg-band each individual, and to record
its weight from time to time. Such a course makes it possible
to learn whether any birds are losing weight, and if
this is the case, these birds must be regarded with suspicion,
and separated from the rest of the flock.</p>

<p>4. If it is known that blackhead is present in any of the
poultry, the yard should be kept free from English sparrows,
and the poultry houses and grain boxes from rats and mice,
which have been shown to carry the causative organism.</p>

<p>5. When it is desired to fatten birds for the market,
begin to increase the rations gradually. Never attempt to
fatten birds which, in successive weighings, show a loss of
weight. Overfeeding does not cause blackhead, but frequently
causes the sudden death of birds in which blackhead
is present.</p>

<p>6. When birds have died of blackhead, their bodies
should be promptly burned or buried in order to prevent the
dissemination of the coccidia, either through the ravages of
rats or skunks, or consequent to the natural processes of decay.</p>
</div>


<h3>BREAKDOWN<br />

<small><i>Not often seen in the poultry yard</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The abdomen becomes en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>larged,
hangs down at the back, and sometimes
touches the ground.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Old layers are generally affected.
The cause may be the strain of heavy
laying, or may in cases be due to too much
internal fat.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> No satisfactory treatment
can be recommended and the bird had best
be killed. Such birds should not be used
for breeding purposes.</p>


<h3>BRONCHITIS (CROUP)<br />

<small><i>Not very common</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Bronchitis may be distinguished
by the rattling in the throat of the
bird affected and by the rapid breathing and
cough. The rattling is due to mucus in
the inflamed bronchial tubes. In bad cases,
birds mope, refuse to eat, and soon die.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Bronchitis may develop from an
ordinary cold, or may be due to sudden
changes of temperature, or to exposure to
rain, cold, and damp.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Keep affected bird away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
from drafts and in a warm place; dose
with Epsom salts (see page 9) and give
soft food, e. g., bread, bran, and middlings,
with milk. Wine of ipecacuanha has been
recommended for cases in which breathing
is very difficult owing to excessive inflammation.</p>


<h3>BROODER PNEUMONIA<br />

<small><i>A very serious disease, causing the death of many
chickens</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Chickens affected stand by
themselves with roughened plumage.
There is a whitish diarrhea, and this disease
can easily be mistaken for white diarrhea.
(See page 92.) Post-mortem examination
will show yellowish spots on the lungs, on
the walls of the air sacs, and on the liver and
other organs, due to infection by the aspergillus
fungus. (See page 29.)</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Infection by a species of the aspergillus
fungus, the spores of which are
probably inhaled. This fungus is common.
The spores may be in the straw used for
nests or for litter, or in the food, especially
if it is at all moldy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> There is no cure for an affected
chicken, and the poultryman must aim
at prevention. Vigorous sanitary measures
are imperative. Clean straw or excelsior
should be used for nests; eggs for hatching
should be disinfected by wiping with 80%
alcohol; incubators and brooders should be
thoroughly disinfected.</p>


<h3>BUMBLEFOOT<br />

<i>Not serious if treated early</i></h3>


<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i047" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i047.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>—BUMBLEFOOT</div>
</div>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Lameness with swelling on
pad of foot.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Injury to sole of foot, developing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
into an abscess. Heavy birds are more subject
than light ones to bumblefoot, especially
if made to roost on perches that are too high.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Paint with iodine. Lance
the abscess if it is sufficiently advanced.
Lower perches. Birds under treatment
should have their feet bandaged, and should
be put on deep straw to prevent further injury
while the wounds are healing. Not
serious if taken in hand promptly.</p>


<h3>CATARRH OF THE CROP<br />

<small><i>Not a common trouble</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Distention of crop with soft
pasty matter of a more or less offensive
character.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Eating stale, putrifying food or
some poisonous matter.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Empty the bird’s crop by
holding the head downwards and gently
pressing the contents out through the mouth.
Feed sparingly on soft food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>


<h3>CHICKEN POX OR SORE HEAD<br />

<small><i>An infectious disease that causes considerable loss among
chickens and young birds in warm climates</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Small, scabby, wart-like
growths and eruptions on the head, especially
on the comb and the wattles and
around the eyes—in bad cases extending to
the lids and even the mouth. Chickens and
young birds are most commonly attacked
by this disease, which spreads rapidly.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i049" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img  src="images/i049.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>—CHICKEN POX</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The specific organism has not
been definitely determined. Chicken pox
may be started by the introduction of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
infected bird, and mosquitoes and other insects
are suspected of being agents in its
spread.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Prompt treatment may be
very successful. Isolate affected birds.
Apply tincture of iodine, first scraping off
the scabs. Creolin 2%, or other disinfectants,
may be used instead of iodine. Dirty
coops are a contributing cause, and cleanliness
of chicken runs and houses is important.
Disinfect soil (see page 13) and woodwork
(see page 12) regularly and with
extra care when the first cases are noticed.
When roupy lesions develop, as is sometimes
the case, treat as for roup. (See page 83.)</p>


<h3>CHOLERA<br />

<small><i>A serious and epidemic form of diarrhea for which no
remedy is known</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Fowls die suddenly with
apparently little reason. There are symptoms
of diarrhea and examination shows
that the feces are a bright yellow or green
instead of the normal color. Before death,
fowls have fever and may be seen moping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and showing evidences of distress. For
post-mortem symptoms see page 112.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A contagious disease, due to
bacteria, that, owing to infection of soil and
drinking water by birds suffering from the
disease, spreads rapidly through a flock.
It is often introduced by the purchase of an
infected bird that appears at the time of
purchase to be well.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Prevention by strict sanitary
measures is what must be aimed at. It
is believed that no cure is known for genuine
cases of cholera. Isolate all new birds
brought into the flock, especially when
cases of cholera are reported in the neighborhood.
The bodies of birds that have
died of this disease are best burnt without
delay. The germ of cholera appears to be
both persistent and easily spread, and too
much stress cannot be laid on the necessity
of preventing its introduction, failing that,
of quickly stamping it out. The sacrifice
of a few birds to prevent the spread of the
disease will be well repaid, for it has been
necessary on occasions to kill a whole flock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
In some cases it has been found best to move
unaffected birds to new quarters.</p>

<p>Fowl typhoid, or leukemia, is a disease
of the blood that may be mistaken for
cholera. The poultryman must treat it in
the same way.</p>


<h3>CLOACITIS OR VENT-GLEET<br />

<small><i>Not a common disease</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Frequent small discharges
of excrement and unsuccessful efforts to
discharge when the cloaca (Fig. 32) is
empty, the mucous membrane of which becomes
hot and inflamed. These symptoms
are soon followed by an offensive discharge.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A specific disease transmitted
from hen to hen by the agency of the cock.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Immediately isolate affected
hens; syringe out cloaca twice daily with
2% creolin; give mild purgative and put
on soft food. Males likely to be affected
should be examined, and diseased birds
killed.</p>

<p><i>Caution.</i> The hands should be carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
cleansed and disinfected, as a serious inflammation
will result if the eyes are rubbed
with infected hands. This is a troublesome
and risky disease to treat.</p>


<h3>COCCIDIOSIS OF ADULT FOWLS<br />

<small><i>The germ of this disease does not usually affect adult fowls
seriously, but causes severe losses among chickens and
turkeys</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The external symptoms are
not very pronounced; there is loss of weight
and in some cases diarrhea. The disease
may last for a long time and birds may even
recover. A post-mortem examination
shows the walls of the cæca thickened and
filled with a pasty mass, while characteristic
whitish or yellowish spots (see Fig.
24, <i>d</i>) are found in the liver.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> This disease is due to the same
germ (a coccidium) that causes blackhead
in turkeys. Adult fowls occasionally develop
this disease, but appear to be able, as
a rule, to act as a host for the germs without
being themselves affected, although heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
losses occur among turkeys or chickens that
get the germ from them.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Copperas in the drinking
water (three grains to a quart) has been
recommended, together with the occasional
use of calomel in one-grain doses, or one or
two teaspoonfuls of castor oil. Thorough
disinfection (see page 10) of houses and
runs, etc., where affected fowls have been,
is important. Burn the bodies of birds that
die of the disease.</p>


<h3>COLD (SIMPLE CATARRH)<br />

<small><i>Dangerous, because it may be confused with the early stages
of roup</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Discharge from the nostrils
and the eyes, with occasional fits of sneezing;
loss of appetite, and moping.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Cold and damp. Colds most
frequently occur in wet weather and among
poorly housed and poorly fed stock.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Warm housing and protection
from cold and wet. Give quinine—one
grain to an adult fowl. Many believe
in dosing fowls suffering from colds with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
red pepper given in the food. When there
are signs of stuffiness, the eyes and the nostrils
should be washed out once or twice
daily. Carbolic acid 2%, or boric acid,
about 3%, dissolved in water, is recommended
for this purpose. Witch hazel has
been found very effective.</p>

<p><i>Caution.</i> There is a risk of mistaking
the early stages of roup for a simple cold.
Further, birds are more likely to contract
roup when suffering from a cold, and
should, on this account, be isolated and
regularly examined.</p>

<p><i>Influenza.</i> The term influenza, or
grippe, is generally applied to a severe cold
that has no symptoms of roup.</p>


<h3>CONSTIPATION<br />

<small><i>Not common and seldom serious</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The bird suffering is dull
and listless. Its efforts to evacuate are
painful and unsuccessful.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Internal blocking of the cloaca
or the intestines, or, occasionally, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
vent by dirt accumulated on the outside.
Want of exercise and lack of green food are
held to be contributing causes.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> If constipation is due to dirt
on the outside, cleanse vent by swabbing
with warm water. When stoppage is inside
and can be felt through the vent
syringe with sweet oil. In other cases, give
a purgative such as castor oil or Epsom
salts. If worms are suspected as the cause,
give santonin (see page 9), followed by a
teaspoonful of castor oil.</p>


<h3>CRAMP<br />

<small><i>Must not be confused with more serious complaints</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Difficulty in standing and
lameness, due to inflammation of muscles
and joints.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Damp and cold.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Put legs of bird in warm
water; rub joints with embrocation and put
in dry quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>—In cases of rheumatism, tick fever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and tuberculosis, birds may show the same
difficulty in standing that they do in cramp.</p>


<h3>CROP-BOUND (IMPACTION OF CROP)<br />

<small><i>Not serious, as a rule</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The crop is hard and
swollen.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The blocking of the passage
from the crop to the gizzard by a bit of
stick or a stone, with the result that the
food cannot pass out of the crop.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Pour sweet oil down fowl’s
throat; work the crop with the fingers, endeavoring
to remove the obstructing object.
If unsuccessful, cut open the crop and remove
the contents, making sure that the
opening into the gizzard is clear. Sew up
the cut made, stitching separately first the
inner skin and then the outer.</p>


<h3>DIARRHEA OR ENTERITIS<br />

<small><i>May take a serious and epidemic form</i></small></h3>


<p>Diarrhea is a common complaint among
fowls, and in some cases takes a severe and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
epidemic form. The latter form may be
due to various causes, and it will be best,
perhaps, to deal with diarrhea under the
following heads:</p>


<ul>
<li>1. Mild diarrhea.</li>
<li>2. Epidemic and severe diarrhea.</li>
<li>3. Dysentery. (See page 52.)</li>
<li>4. Cholera. (See page 39.)</li>
<li>5. White diarrhea of chickens. (See page 92.)</li>
</ul>



<h4><i>Mild Diarrhea</i>.</h4>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Looseness of bowels and
staining of feathers around the anus with
excreta.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Indigestion caused by food
which may be too laxative; e. g., excess of
bran, or, by food which may be partly decomposed
or may contain an intestinal irritant.
Cold may also be a cause.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Give Epsom salts, or castor
oil. (See page 9.) Change diet if food
is suspected. Often no treatment is necessary,
but it is not wise to neglect cases that
are apparently mild diarrhea, for fear they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
may turn out to be an epidemic and contagious
form.</p>


<h4><i>Diarrhea, Severe and Epidemic</i></h4>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Excessive looseness of
bowels, ruffling of feathers, depression, loss
of appetite. A number of birds in the flock
are attacked and death results.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> There are a variety of causes.
Scientific investigation has led to the discovery
of specific organisms responsible for
various forms of diarrhea. It would be
well for poultry rearers to study the results
of such work, but, for the purposes of this
book, it will be sufficient to state that the
causal organism may be bacterial, mycotic,
or protozoan. The owner of poultry will
not usually be able himself to determine
what type of diarrhea the fowls are suffering
from, but as a rule the treatment will
have to be the same. Advice will have to
be sought from an expert when dangerous
epidemics are feared.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> The most energetic meas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>ures
of disinfection must be undertaken.
(See page 10.)</p>

<ul>
<li class="hang">1. Isolate sick fowls.</li>

<li class="hang">2. Disinfect soil of run thoroughly.</li>

<li class="hang">3. Clean and disinfect coops.</li>

<li class="hang">4. In bad cases, remove the rest of
the flock from the infested run.</li>

<li class="hang">5. Give sick fowls Epsom salts, or
castor oil; feed fowls on soft
food.</li>

<li class="hang">6. If the diarrhea is not checked,
give 6 to 12 drops of chlorodyne.</li>
</ul>



<h3>DIPHTHERIA OR DIPHTHERITIC ROUP<br />

<small><i>A dangerous disease, and infected birds should be killed
at once</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> A cold, accompanied by
whitish and yellowish patches on the back
of the throat and in the mouth. These
patches apparently form a false membrane
and cannot be torn off without causing
bleeding. The disease is sometimes known
as canker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i061" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i061.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—DIPHTHERITIC ROUP<br />
<i>b</i>, lower beak; <i>t</i>, tongue; <i>m</i>, false membrane.<br />
(After Harrison and Streit.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> This disease is often clearly a
later stage of roup. It is difficult to say
where one ends and the other begins. It
has been claimed that the organism is the
same as that which causes diphtheria in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
human beings, but the weight of evidence
is against this conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Diphtheria is extremely infectious.
It is best to kill the first cases at
once. If the bird is of particular value, it
may be isolated and the patches on the
throat swabbed with 50% hydrogen peroxide
or 5% creolin, with a small bit of
cotton wool wound around a stick. If
great care is exercised, 20% carbolic acid
or 20% creolin may be painted on the
patches, but neither should be allowed to
touch the normal skin. Burn the swabs.
Treat accompanying roupy symptoms as
recommended under roup.</p>

<p>The term canker is also applied to certain
spots or growths that occur on the
throat. These are not in any way associated
with diphtheritic roup, or any dangerous,
contagious disease, and are due to injury
or to an unhealthy condition of the
mucous membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>


<h3>DROPSY<br/>

<small><i>Not a common disease</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Distention of abdomen.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Collection of liquid in abdominal
cavity.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Treatment is seldom successful.
It is best and most merciful to kill
the afflicted bird. If it is desired to make
an effort to save the bird, carefully puncture
the lower portion of the abdomen with
a trocar and squeeze out the liquid. Give
invalid diet.</p>


<h3>DYSENTERY<br />

<small><i>Serious if in epidemic form</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Severe diarrhea with blood
in the discharges.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Bacterial or other specific infection
of the intestines. Occasionally the eating
of some poisonous or irritating substance
will give rise to blood in the excrement.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Isolate bird, and give six to
eight drops of chlorodyne on a small piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
of bread. Thorough disinfection (see
page 10) of water, soil and house is necessary
to prevent this disease spreading.</p>


<h3>EGG-BOUND<br />

<small><i>An uncommon complaint</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The hen goes on and off
the nest straining to lay. Generally the egg
may be felt through the vent. After straining
for some time, she may succeed in laying
the egg, and treatment should not be
undertaken until it is evident that the fowl
needs assistance.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Very young hens are more liable
to this complaint, which arises from eggs of
an abnormal size, from lack of muscular
power, or from some other disorder of the
oviduct.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> It will be most merciful to
kill fowls in much distress, as treatment is
tedious and painful to the fowl. It has
been recommended to hold the fowl’s vent
over steam from boiling water and then to
pass an oiled finger up the vent. In bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
cases, pierce the egg and withdraw the contents,
then break the shell and remove all
the pieces. Great care must be taken to
leave no particle of the broken shell behind.</p>


<h3>EGG-EATING<br />

<small><i>A bad habit that may be controlled</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> If remains of eggs are seen
in nests or runs, the poultryman should become
suspicious and make observations to
prove whether any of his flock are eating
eggs.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Broken eggs or soft-shelled eggs
left about the yard may be the cause of hens
acquiring this bad habit.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> All signs of broken eggs
should always be immediately removed.
The culprit, when detected, should be removed
to a different pen and nest. Dark
nests have been recommended. A trap nest
will prevent a hen from getting at her egg.</p>


<h3>EMPHYSEMA (AIR UNDER SKIN)<br />

<small><i>Not a common disease of chickens</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> In this disease of chickens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the skin becomes puffed out in one or more
places, generally on the neck. In rare cases
the puffing spreads over nearly the whole
of the body.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> This disease is evidently caused
by some obstruction of the air passages that
forces the air to escape under the skin.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Let out the air by puncturing
the skin. Give soft and nourishing
food. It will probably be wiser not to use
birds that recover from this complaint for
breeding stock.</p>


<h3>EPILEPSY<br />

<small><i>An unusual complaint</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The bird staggers about and
has a fit. It may recover.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> It is difficult to discover a cause;
intestinal worms are suspected in some
cases.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> If it is suspected that intestinal
worms are responsible, try the treatment
recommended for worms. (See
page 95.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>


<h3>FATTY DEGENERATION<br />

<small><i>Not contagious, but pointing to error in diet</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> More or less sudden deaths
of birds in good condition. Post-mortem
examination shows an enlarged liver and
masses of fat attached to the intestines.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Something wrong with the diet;
too much heat-giving food and want of exercise.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>. Post-mortem proof of fatty
degeneration in the flock should lead the
poultry owner to change the diet, reducing
the amount of heat-giving food, and giving
more exercise. Some authors draw attention
to a fatty degeneration in which the
liver is shrunken and shows fat globules
under the microscope.</p>


<h3>FAVUS (WHITE COMB)<br />

<small><i>Disfiguring, but easily controlled if treated early</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Whitish scabs or crusts on
the comb, the head and down the neck.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Due to a fungus that spreads, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
not treated, and that probably starts where
there is an abrasion of the skin.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Treat in early stages of the
disease by dressing with sulphur ointment.
(See page 9.) Isolate bird. If the case
has been neglected and allowed to develop,
the crusts must first be moistened with oil
and the surface scraped off with a blunt
instrument. Then apply tincture of iodine
or nitrate of silver.</p>


<h3>FEATHER-EATING<br />

<small><i>Not a very common habit</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The presence of bare patches
and injured plumage on birds should lead
the poultryman to watch for feather-eaters.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Irritation from insects, some
defect in diet, or natural cussedness.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Isolate the offender, and, if
persistent and of no special value, kill, for
fear the bad example may be followed by
others. If several fowls develop this vice,
try hanging up a bone for them to peck at
and thus distract their attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>


<h3>FLEAS<br />

<small><i>An occasional parasite of poultry</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Fleas are found on the fowls
or in the straw of their nests.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i> The flea that attacks fowls
is known as the hen flea (<i>Pulex gallinæ</i>).
It is dark colored and has sharp mouth
parts. Doubtless it causes the fowl it attacks
much irritation in addition to loss of
blood.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Keep poultry houses in a
clean, sanitary condition. Dust the infested
fowls with an insect powder or dip them in
creolin, about 1%. Burn infested straw.</p>


<h3>FRACTURES</h3>

<p>Broken bones of legs or wings can be
mended by placing the bones back in their
proper positions and binding with light
splints. The splints may be removed in
about four weeks. It will be found that
shanks are easily set, but that broken wings
give far more trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>If a fowl dislocates its leg or its wing,
the joint should be gently pushed back into
place.</p>


<h3>FROST BITE<br />

<small><i>A strain on the bird’s system</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Combs and wattles are most
liable to frost bite, particularly in breeds
in which these parts are large.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Exposure to very low temperatures,
especially if birds are suddenly
turned out from warm quarters; dipping
comb and wattles in water when the temperature
is low.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Prevent by keeping birds as
warm as possible during winter, and do not
allow them to go out early in the mornings
in very cold weather. Drinking water
should be provided in a vessel from which
birds can drink without wetting their
wattles. In a case of frost bite, thaw the
affected parts by gently rubbing with vaseline
and afterwards treat with a mixture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
two grains of salicylic acid to one ounce of
vaseline or lard.</p>


<h3>GAPES<br />

<small><i>Serious in badly infested yards</i></small>
</h3>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i071" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i071.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—GAPES<br />
On left: Chicken affected with gapes. On right: <i>a</i>, male and female
gape worms; <i>b</i>, gape worms in windpipe. (From Salmon.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Frequent gaping and coughing;
young chicks attacked, as a rule.
Notice if any worms are coughed up by the
chicken; if none can be found, but the gaping
continues, put a stripped feather down
the windpipe, as recommended under treatment,
and see if any gape worms can be
pulled up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Small worms, red in color when
engorged, which attach themselves to the
mucous membrane of the windpipe. Affected
birds cough up worms or ova, which
infect the yard and sometimes the water
supply. Earthworms taken from infested
yards have been found to contain portions
of gape worms, and may be one means of
infecting poultry.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Isolate attacked poultry and
disinfect coops and yards. The worms may
be extracted from the windpipe of a gaping
chicken with a feather stripped nearly to
the end, and moistened, but not dripping,
with oil of turpentine. Hold the mouth
open, push the feather down the windpipe,
and give it a sudden twist, which will dislodge
the worms and allow of their being
drawn up. Fumigation by holding the
bird’s head over an irritant vapor, such as
that of carbolic acid poured into boiling
water, is risky, but sometimes successful. If
not cautiously done, much suffering may be
inflicted on the bird.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem.</i> Cut open the windpipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and look for the worms, which may be
easily recognized by Fig. 12. Male and
female specimens will be found attached to
one another.</p>


<h3>GASTRITIS (CATARRH OF THE STOMACH)<br />

<small><i>Not a common complaint</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> This disease cannot be
readily diagnosed while the fowl is living;
it is generally associated with catarrh of the
crop. (See page 37.) The symptoms are
similar. Post-mortem examination will
show the lining of the stomach in an inflamed
condition.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The inflammation of the lining
of the stomach is generally due to eating decomposing
food or other poisonous matter.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Empty the crop as recommended
under Catarrh of the crop. Give
one or two tablespoonfuls of castor oil and
feed on soft and easily digested food with
milk or barley water. Be sure that poultry
are not allowed to run under trees that have
been sprayed with arsenical poisons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>


<h3>GOUT<br />

<small><i>Not a common ailment</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The bird sometimes loses
weight, and as the disease develops shows
stiffness and an indisposition to stand. In
some cases small nodules containing crystals
of urate of soda occur on the underside
of the toes.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Failure of the kidneys to perform
their normal functions and consequent
accumulation of urates in the bird’s system
in excessive quantities. Gout may be due
to too concentrated feeding.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Medicines and treatment
are of little avail. Endeavor to prevent by
feeding a mixed diet.</p>

<p><i>Post-mortem.</i> In one form of this disease,
known as visceral gout, the liver and
other abdominal organs are covered over
with a powder-like deposit of the crystals of
urate of soda.</p>


<h3>HEART DISEASES<br />

<small><i>Not common, and cannot be treated</i></small></h3>

<p>The heart is an organ that is subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
several serious diseases, but these cannot be
detected with any certainty while the bird
is living, and treatment cannot be recommended
as likely to be successful. Post-mortem
examination may show the following
symptoms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The heart sac full of serous liquid,
in the case of pericarditis, or
dropsy of the heart sac.</p>

<p>2. A reddening of the membrane lining
the heart, in the case of inflammation
(endocarditis).</p>

<p>3. An enlarged heart, in the case of
enlargement of the heart.</p>

<p>4. Hemorrhage, in the case of rupture
of the heart and of the
blood vessels.</p>
</div>


<h3>INDIGESTION<br />

<small><i>Disorder of the intestinal tract, that is not very serious</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The bird mopes and shows
signs of a capricious appetite. Either diarrhea
or, less commonly, constipation, may
be a symptom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Disorders of the digestive tract,
due to error in dieting—for example, overfeeding,
or too little green food and not
enough exercise.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Alter the feeding, see that
the water is clean, and give a dose of Epsom
salts. (See page 9.)</p>


<h3>JAUNDICE<br />

<small><i>Not a common disease</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> A yellow comb may indicate
jaundice, but there are no definite external
symptoms. Post-mortem examination
shows distention of the gall bladder, due to
an excessive secretion of bile.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Said to be due to continued congestion
of the liver, arising possibly from
too much heat-giving food.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> If the disease is suspected,
give one grain of calomel as a purgative and
feed on more green food.</p>


<h3>KIDNEY DISEASES<br />

<small><i>With the exception of gout, kidney diseases cannot be
detected by external symptoms</i></small></h3>


<p>Gout (see page 63) is the commonest dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>ease
of the kidneys. In addition, there are
some disorders of the kidneys (e. g., enlargement)
that may be noticed on post-mortem
examination. Little is known about
these diseases; there are no symptoms that
can be recognized before death, and no
treatment can be recommended.</p>


<h3>LEG WEAKNESS<br />

<small><i>Constitutional weakness, to which the heavier breeds are
more subject than are the lighter ones</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Fowls walk in an unsteady
manner, without showing any specific cause
for lameness. Young birds are more likely
to be affected in this manner, particularly
those of the heavier breeds.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Too rapid growth, the bird outgrowing
the strength of its legs.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Reduce the quantity of fat-producing
foods. Care in the selection of
breeding stock is important.</p>


<h3>LICE<br />

<small><i>Invariably present in small numbers, and likely to become a
serious pest, if not persistently controlled</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Unthrifty look of fowl and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
signs of irritation; desertion of nest by
setting hens; and, of course, the detection
of lice on the fowl: this may be done by
quickly turning over the feathers on the
body and looking for the lice.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i078" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.—Three Lice
That Commonly Affect Fowls</span> (From Salmon.)<br />
<i>a.</i> Lipeurus variabilis.<br />
<i>b</i>, Menopon pallidum.<br />
<i>c</i>, Goniodes dissimilis.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Introduction of an infested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
fowl; neglect to dust fowls
regularly to keep down lice,
and to clean out fowl houses
and change the straw of nest
boxes. At the season that
lice are likely to be most
prevalent the poultryman
should take precautionary
measures.</p>

<p><i>Description of lice.</i> Lice
are small insects ranging in
size from 1∕25 to 1∕8 of an
inch. They breed rapidly,
laying their eggs on the
feathers. They are not
blood-sucking insects, but
cause much irritation to the
birds they infest.</p>

<p>Several species are found
on fowls. Fig. 14 shows three
of the common species.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Dust fowls
with fresh insect powder
(pyrethrum). Smear sulphur
ointment on head and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
under wings, especially in the case of
chickens. Infested fowls may be dipped
in 2% creolin. Dust setting hens with a
lice powder before putting them on their
nests. Infested straw should be burnt, and
boxes, nests, fixtures, etc., should be thoroughly
sprayed with 2% creolin.</p>


<h3>LIMBER-NECK<br />

<small><i>An occasional complaint</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The muscles of the fowl’s
neck become so relaxed that they cannot
support the head.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Limber-neck, due to partial or
entire paralysis of the muscles of the neck,
is believed to be associated with acute indigestion
or worms.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> A strong purgative may be
the means of effecting a cure by cleaning
out any intestinal poisons and thus correcting
the cause. If the treatment recommended
does not effect a cure in a few days,
kill the bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>


<h3>LIVER DISEASES</h3>

<p>The liver is affected by several diseases,
and the poultryman, who finds a spotted
liver on post-mortem examination, will be
much aided in determining the cause, if he
takes into consideration the symptoms
noticed before the fowl died, as well as the
changes in the other internal organs. The
importance of the post-mortem examination
is in distinguishing whether the death of the
fowl is due to a contagious disease.</p>

<p>The causes of diseased livers may be conveniently
divided into two classes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Diseased livers due to indigestion,
e. g., enlargement.</p>

<p>2. Diseased livers due to a specific
disease, e. g., tuberculosis.</p>
</div>


<p class="center"><i>Diseases Due to Indigestion</i></p>

<p>In this class may be included degeneration,
inflammation, congestion, enlargement,
and atrophy of the liver. There are more
or less distinct differences in these diseases,
but the only possible methods of treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
known at present are very much the same.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> There are no definite external
symptoms. The poultryman’s suspicions
should, however, be aroused if fowls
apparently in good health die suddenly. A
post-mortem examination will reveal a liver
of abnormal size, or somewhat shrunken,
and of unhealthy texture.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The cause is generally something
wrong in the feeding. Fowls may be eating
too large a proportion of heat-producing
foods and not enough green food. If
an enlarged liver is associated with an excessive
layer of fat covering the internal
organs, it points to too large quantities of
carbohydrates.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Correct errors in feeding.
Give more green food and let the fowls
scratch for some of their grain. If errors
in feeding and general management are not
obvious, make experimental changes.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Diseased Livers Due to Specific Diseases</i></p>

<p>Tuberculosis, coccidiosis, gout and other
specific diseases are responsible for spotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
or diseased livers. (Fig. 24.) The section
on diagnosis by post-mortem examination
gives further information on these subjects
and shows how the principal diseases
may be distinguished.</p>

<p>The term cancer is sometimes applied to
cases in which there are tumors on the liver.</p>


<h3>MAGGOTS<br />

<small><i>Occasionally found in flesh wounds of poultry</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> A flesh wound that instead
of healing develops into a sore with a slight
running. On examination, maggots will be
found.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Several species of flies are always
ready to lay their eggs in any available
wound or sore; therefore wounds must be
watched in the case of poultry, as with all
other animals of the farmyard. The eggs
laid by these flies hatch and develop into
small footless grubs commonly known as
maggots.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Wash the wound with 1 to
2% creolin; remove as many of the maggots
as possible with a pair of tweezers or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
feather. If the maggots are deep-seated,
stuff the wound with a cotton wad saturated
with strong creolin or 10% carbolic acid.
Examine next day and remove dead maggots.
Treat again in a similar manner if
the maggots are not all killed. Fish oil, or
iodoform made into a paste with vaseline,
will prevent the flies depositing
their eggs, if smeared on the surface of
the wound.</p>


<h3>MITES (AIR-SAC)<br />

<small><i>Not a common parasite</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> There are no definite external
symptoms. If the bird is very badly
affected, there may be evidences of suffocation.
This may end fatally. A post-mortem
examination will show the mites in the
air passages and bronchi as small yellowish
and whitish particles, which on careful observation
may be seen to move.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp25" id="i085" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img src="images/i085.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15<br />
The Air Sac Mite</span>(From Salmon.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A small mite (<i>Sarcoptes lævis</i>)
which infests the air sacs and bronchi.
These mites, when present in large numbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
obstruct the air passages and cause suffocation.
A secretion from the mucous membrane
affected, results from
the presence of the mites
and increases the obstruction
of the air passages.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> The fumigation
method tried for gapes
has been recommended,
but there is little reason
to expect success.</p>


<h3>MITES, DEPLUMING (SCABIES)</h3>

<div class="figright illowp25" id="i085a" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img  src="images/i085a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>
<span class="smcap">The Depluming Mite</span>(From Salmon.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Bare patches on the bird’s
body due to the loss of
feathers. The rump and
the breast are most frequently
attacked.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A small mite
(<i>Sarcoptes lævis</i>) found
on the bird’s body near the
base of the fallen feathers.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Isolate affected
birds; rub bare
patches and neighboring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
portion of body with sulphur ointment (see
page 9) or dip body of fowl in a solution
of about 2% creolin.</p>


<h3>MITES (RED MITE)<br />

<small><i>A serious pest</i></small></h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Unthriftiness of birds.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A small whitish mite, which appears
red when filled with blood. These
mites suck the bird’s blood at night and hide
during the day in the sockets
of the perches and in the
crevices of the woodwork.</p>

<div class="figright illowp25" id="i086" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img src="images/i086.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">The Red Mite</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Examine the
fowl house at night. Dust
hens with an insect powder;
thoroughly spray houses and
perches with 5% creolin or
other disinfectant, and squirt kerosene oil
or turpentine into cracks and crevices. A
specially constructed mite-proof perch, or
one that can be easily removed, should
be used.</p>


<h3>MOLTING</h3>

<p>Molting is not a disease, but may prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
trying to poultry not in the best condition
to stand the strain of the process. Hens
overtaxed with forced laying and cocks
running with too large a number of hens are
most likely to suffer. Molting occurs in
healthy adult birds every twelve months.
The process, which is a natural one, should
be allowed to take its natural course unless
the fowls appear weak and depressed during
the period. In such cases specially
nourishing and stimulating food should be
given. Anyhow, it would be well to pay
particular attention to the feeding of birds
during the molting season.</p>


<h3>OVARY DISEASES</h3>

<p>Hens suffer from various diseases of the
ovary, which may become shriveled and useless
or gangrenous. Tumorous growths,
sometimes called cancers, are also found.
As diseased conditions of this organ can be
detected only by post-mortem examination,
and as no remedies are known, the subject
need not be dealt with more fully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>


<h3>OVIDUCT, DISEASES OF</h3>

<p>Abnormal eggs must be regarded as due
to functional disorders of the oviduct. One
cause of soft eggs is lack of shell-forming
material; therefore a liberal supply of
powdered oyster shells, or lime in some
other form, should always be accessible to
laying hens. Other abnormal eggs occur,
such as those with double yolks, without
any yolk, with blood clots, etc. No treatment
can be suggested beyond feeding a
varied diet and avoiding too stimulating or
over-heating foods.</p>

<p>Prolapse of the oviduct may occur. The
protruding portion should be oiled or vaselined
and gently pressed back.</p>


<h3>PERITONITIS<br />

<small><i>Not common and not contagious</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Loss of appetite, fever and
evidence of discomfort and pain in the
stomach, especially if the abdomen is
pressed with the hand. Post-mortem
examination shows inflamed appearance of
membrane of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Serious inflammation of the
wall of the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Put the bird in a quiet place.
Aconite (see page 9), to reduce the temperature,
and opium, or one drop of laudanum,
to relieve pain, have been recommended,
but as a rule it is best to kill the bird.</p>


<h3>PIP<br />

<small><i>Generally the effect of some other disorder</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> A hardened scale formed at
tip of tongue.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Generally due to cold or other
disorder affecting the breathing of the bird.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Do not try to tear off the
growth on the tongue by force, but moisten
with vaseline or glycerin until it becomes
loose. Give soft food.</p>


<h3>PNEUMONIA AND CONGESTION OF LUNGS<br />

<small><i>Generally fatal</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Extreme depression and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
great difficulty in breathing. Difficult to
distinguish in the living bird from a very
bad cold. Post-mortem examination shows
the affected lung filled with an exudate.
The lung sinks if put in water.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Following on a cold, the lung
becomes congested with blood and a dark,
viscous matter. Pneumonia may be considered
a further, and generally final, stage
of congestion.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> A cure is seldom effected,
but in the case of a valuable bird the following
treatment may be tried Keep the bird
in a dry, warm place; paint the skin above
the lungs with tincture of iodine; give
aconite. Feed on soft food and give a
stimulant.</p>


<h3>POISONING</h3>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> As a rule the poisons that
fowls eat are mineral. The most pronounced
symptom is evidence of pain. In
cases of arsenical poison there is diarrhea.
A poison containing a copper compound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
acts partly as an emetic, causing the fowl
to make an effort to vomit. In cases of
mineral poisons, post-mortem examinations
show inflammation of the stomach and the
digestive tract.</p>

<p><i>Sources of poison.</i> Poultry are likely to
get poisoned from the following sources:</p>

<p><i>Fertilizers</i> (e. g., nitrate of soda) used
on fields in which fowls scratch for food.
Such cases are rare.</p>

<p><i>Insecticides and fungicides</i> (e. g., Paris
green [arsenic], lead arsenate, Bordeaux
mixture) applied to plants under which
fowls run. If sprays are mixed in correct
proportions and used in normal quantities,
there is little danger to poultry feeding on
the grass below sprayed trees. Great care
should, however, be taken in disposing of
the sediment and the residue after spraying
operations are completed.</p>

<p><i>Rat poisons</i> (e. g., phosphorus, strychnine,
baryta). These poisons are particularly
dangerous when mixed with cornmeal
or other bait attractive to fowls. The best
way to set rat poison is to put it in a piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
of piping of such a diameter and length that
fowls cannot reach it.</p>

<p><i>Salt.</i> Food mixed with salt for other
domestic animals may be accidentally given
to fowls. Chickens are the most likely to
be poisoned by excess of salt.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> If fowls have eaten poisonous
substances, the fact is not usually discovered
until after death or until it is too
late to administer an antidote. Most of the
poisons fowls are likely to eat act as irritants
of the digestive tract. Milk and
white of egg should be given. It is advisable
to give a stimulant, such as half a teaspoonful
of brandy.</p>


<h3>PYÆMIA<br />

<small><i>Not contagious, and not common</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> This disease cannot be diagnosed
except by post-mortem examination
and microscopic identification of pus-forming
organisms in the infected areas (whitish
spots) of liver, spleen, etc.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Pus-forming organisms believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to enter the blood through a wound in the
skin.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> As there are no external
symptoms, treatment is not possible.</p>


<h3>RHEUMATISM<br />

<small><i>Not a common trouble</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Lameness and stiffness of
joints.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> May be due in some cases to too
stimulating food and to dampness.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Put affected bird in dry
quarters and vary food, adding more greens.
Rub joints with embrocation, or turpentine
and oil.</p>


<h3>ROUP (CONTAGIOUS CATARRH)<br />

<small><i>One of the most serious contagious diseases</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> The bird first has symptoms
of an ordinary cold, such as running at the
nostrils and sneezing. Definite evidence of
roup is the <i>offensive odor</i> detected on opening
the bird’s mouth. The exudate is also
offensive. The disease may attack the eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
which then become inflamed and swollen;
a tumor, containing offensive, yellowish,
cheesy matter, sometimes develops. The
course of the disease may extend over several
weeks or months and there may be cases
of chronic roup. Some cases end fatally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
in a comparatively short time. The form
of the disease, in which yellowish patches
develop on the throat, is dealt with under
diphtheria or diphtheritic roup.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i095" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img  src="images/i095.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>—EXAMINING A FOWL WITH A SUSPICIOUS COLD</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Cases of roup occur when birds
are subjected to draft and damp, but the
cause must be infection with disease germs.
It is believed that the almost constant presence
of the germs is due to lack of regular
disinfection and to birds in the flock believed
to have recovered from a previous
attack of the disease, but that, in reality, are
suffering from chronic roup, and are able,
whenever suitable conditions arise for an
outbreak of this disease, to infect the rest of
the flock through the drinking water and
the soil.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> The seriousness of this disease
makes it imperative for the poultry
rearer to isolate immediately any birds
showing any suspicious symptoms. If
treatment of the infected bird is taken in
hand early, and carried out faithfully, a
cure can be effected, but it is often wiser to
kill and burn infected stock. In treating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
birds, the mouth and nostrils should be
washed out with 5% carbolic acid, or with
50% hydrogen peroxide, or with 2% permanganate
of potash. It is important to
clean out the passage of the nostrils, and
this may be done by:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Pressing against the roof of the
bird’s mouth from inside and
squeezing the nostrils from
above downwards.</p>

<p>2. Syringing out the nostrils.</p>

<p>3. Dipping the fowl’s head for a few
seconds in a solution of the disinfectant.
Great care should be
exercised in this method of
treatment, which is only recommended
when permanganate of
potash is used.</p>
</div>

<p>It is well to keep birds isolated for some
time after apparent recovery. When the
eye is affected (see Fig. 20), the tumor
should be carefully lanced and the cheesy
matter removed, after which the cavity

recommended above; such treatment
may have to be repeated time after
time.</p>

<p>As an after effect of a cold or of roup,
conjunctivitis or sore eyes may develop. A
discharge comes from the eyes and the eyelids
become stuck together. Bathe the eyes
with hydrogen peroxide mixed with an
equal quantity of water.</p>

<p>If this condition follows an attack of

<h3>SCALY LEG<br />

<small><i>An unsightly affection that, although contagious, does not
spread rapidly</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> A rough and scaly growth
on the legs of the bird.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> A small mite (Fig. 22), known
as <i>Sarcoptes mutans</i>, burrows in the skin
and gives rise to the unsightly growth
(Fig. 21) that gives this disease its name.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.-The Mite
That Causes Scaly Leg</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Soften the scaly growth by
washing and soaking the legs with warm
water and soap. Scrub the affected portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of the legs with a brush and then treat as
follows: Dip the legs in kerosene oil,
holding them there for not
longer than a few seconds. If
the kerosene oil is mixed with
sweet oil, or if the legs are wet
first with water, there will be
no risk of the kerosene proving
harsh, as sometimes happens.
Sulphur ointment (see
page 9) may be used instead of the kerosene
oil treatment.</p>



<h3>SOFT CROP<br />

<small><i>Not a serious complaint</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Distended crop, soft to the
feel.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Over-eating; or food turning
sour in the crop.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Hold bird downwards and
squeeze contents of crop through mouth,
taking care not to suffocate the patient.
Repeat treatment if necessary. Put on low
diet for some time, feeding slowly and
sparingly.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The fowl tick (<i>Argas minatus</i>),
which hides during the day in
cracks and crevices, sucks the
fowl’s blood at night and introduces
a fever-producing parasite.</p>

<p><i>Remedies.</i> Examine sick
birds during the day, and visit
the roosts at night, for proof of the presence
of ticks; carefully search under perches, in
nests, and in corners of woodwork, etc.
Spray woodwork with 5% creolin; squirt
kerosene oil, or turpentine, into cracks and
crevices.</p>


<h3>TUBERCULOSIS<br />

<small><i>A very serious poultry disease</i></small></h3>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i> This disease may be present
in a poultry yard for some time without
being detected. Suspicion should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
aroused if birds gradually lose weight and
die. If a bird that
has gradually been
getting thinner, goes
lame, or loses the use
of a wing, without apparent
injury, the evidence
that tuberculosis
is present is
strong, but positive
proof of its presence
can be obtained only
by post-mortem and
microscopic examination.
This disease generally
attacks adult
birds.</p>

<p><i>Cause.</i> The specific
organism causing this
disease, known as the
<i>Bacillus tuberculosis</i>
(Fig. 5), infects the
liver (Fig. 24), the
spleen (Fig. 24), and
other organs, least fre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>quently
the lungs. The disease may be introduced
into a flock by the purchase of an
infected bird, and may be spread by uninfected
birds picking up the excrement of
diseased birds with their food.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> There is no known cure.
The insidious manner in which this disease
advances through a poultry yard makes it
a very serious malady. Birds suffering
from it should be killed and burnt.
Thorough disinfection of coops, etc., should
be made. Strict attention to sanitation will
help in preventing and controlling this disease.
If many birds in a flock are believed
to have tuberculosis, it would be well to
destroy the whole flock and start again,
preferably on fresh ground.</p>


<h3>WHITE DIARRHEA OF CHICKENS<br />

<small><i>A very serious disease, causing the death of large numbers</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> Chickens are generally attacked
when 10 to 15 days old. They appear
listless, their feathers become rough,
and they stand about with drooping wings.
A white diarrhea is soon noticed. Chicken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
after chicken shows similar symptoms and
dies, resulting in much loss and discouragement
to the poultry rearer.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—HEALTHY CHICKENS<br />
Normal ten-day White Leghorn chickens. (After Rettger &amp; Stoneburn.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Various causes, such as improper
or stale food, may upset the chicken’s
digestive organs and give rise to a
whitish diarrhea, but the term “white diarrhea”
is best restricted to a contagious form
of diarrhea due to minute parasites in the
intestinal tracts of chickens. A coccidium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and a bacillus have been proved by different
investigators to cause very similar forms of
white diarrhea. A distinct form of white
diarrhea, known as brooder pneumonia, is
described on page 35.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> This disease is a very difficult
one to control. Incubators and
brooders should be thoroughly disinfected.
Special care should be taken in the feeding
during the first few weeks. Chickens
should not be overfed. The feeding of
dry bran is recommended, as it tends to keep
the bowels in a healthy, active condition.
In the form of white diarrhea due to a
bacillus, suspicion rests on the hen and the
egg as sources of infection. When the disease
becomes serious, and general sanitation
and proper care of chickens do not control
it, the advisability of obtaining the eggs for
hatching from a poultry farm free of white
diarrhea should be considered.</p>


<h3>WORMS<br />

<small><i>Intestinal parasites that occasionally become serious</i></small></h3>


<p><i>Symptoms.</i> General debility; worms or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
segments of worms; seen in the droppings.
If there is doubt as to whether a flock is
suffering from worms, give a suspected
bird a strong purgative and keep it up so
that the feces may be examined for worms.
If doubt still
exists, the suspected
bird
should be killed
and a post-mortem
examination
made. Cut
the intestines
open lengthways
(see Fig.
34) with a small
pair of scissors
and wash them out with water so as to detect
the smaller worms, and the tapeworms
attached to the lining of the intestines.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.—Worms in Intestinal Tract
of Fowl</span><br />
(After Bradshaw. From Pearl, Surface &amp; Curtis.)</div>
</div>

<p><i>Cause.</i> Two classes of worms are commonly
parasitic on fowls—round worms
(see Fig. 27) and tapeworms. There are
generally a few specimens of worms in the
intestines of fowls; but only when the
numbers are large do worms affect the health
of the fowl.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Every bird suspected of
having worms may be tested with a purgative
as suggested above. Or, if it is established
that several birds in a flock are suffering
from worms, all in poor condition,
without any cause being apparent, should
be dosed with santonin—three to five grains
in the morning before any food has been
picked up. After about two hours give a
purgative of two teaspoonfuls of castor oil
and soon after let the fowl have its morning
food. As important as dosing the fowls, is
disinfecting the feed troughs, the water vessels,
and the soil of the runs in order to prevent
re-infection.</p>

<p><i>Nodular tæniasis.</i> Small nodules on the
intestines, resembling the nodules in tuberculosis,
are sometimes caused by tapeworms.
The name “nodular tæniasis” has been given
to this disease.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Post-mortem Examinations</span></small></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>1. Making the Examination</i></h3>

<p>A post-mortem examination should
always be undertaken if there is any
doubt as to the cause of death. Poultry
rearers who are not already familiar with
the normal appearance of the internal organs
of a fowl should take the first opportunity
of studying them.</p>

<p>Post-mortem examinations should be
done in a systematic manner; but, if desired,
a very speedy examination may be
made by rapidly removing, or bending back,
the breast bone of the unplucked bird.</p>

<p>It will be more generally satisfactory,
however, to devote time to the operation,
and it is suggested that the work be carried
out on the following lines:</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>1. Nail the body of the dead fowl on
a board in the position shown
in Fig. 30, having first partly
or wholly plucked the bird.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i111" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

Fowl nailed on board; lines A B, A C and B D show where to cut.</div>
</div>

<p>2. With a sharp knife cut along
lines AC, BD (Fig. 30), and
bend the breast bone backwards,
exposing the internal
organs. (Fig. 31.) As the
breast bone is raised it will be
necessary to cut through the
mesentery and other connecting
tissues. Break it back at D,
cutting through the flesh and
the muscle with sharp scissors.</p>

<p>3. Remove heart, liver, gall-bladder
and spleen, making neat severances
and without injury to
any of the other organs. If the
heart or large blood vessels be
injured in the operation, blood
will flow out and interfere with
the work.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i113" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i113.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 2<br />
Breast bone removed; internal organs in situ.</div>
</div>


<p>4. Cut through the œsophagus, below
or above the crop, as most
convenient, and also cut
through the large intestine near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the cloaca. Without disconnecting
the parts, lift out the
gizzard, intestines, and other
portions of the alimentary
canal, carefully tearing away
the membranous tissues of the
mesentery.</p>

<p>5. Spread the organs out and examine
each one carefully and
critically, making sections if
necessary. (Fig. 32.)</p>

<p>6. Cut open gullet, crop, stomach,
gizzard, intestines, and cæca
and examine the contents.</p>

<p>7. Examine the lungs, cutting off a
portion and throwing it into
water, when it will float if
healthy, but sink if congested.</p>

<p>8. Cut through the skin of the neck.
Sever the windpipe near the
head, and also where the bronchi
enter the lungs. With
scissors cut it open, and examine
for molds or gapes or for exudates
indicative of various forms of cold or lung congestion.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

Internal organs removed for examination.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>


<p class="hang">9. Examine the brain (Fig. 34) for
blood clots. Some care will be
necessary in cutting through
the skull so as not to injure the
brain tissue, which should be a
milky white. A sharp and
strong pair of scissors or a
small, fine saw (e. g., tenon
saw) will be useful for older
birds. Remove the skin and
cut from behind, raising the
bones and exposing the brain.</p>


<h3><i>2. The Normal Condition of the
Internal Organs</i></h3>

<p class="center">(See Fig. 32.)</p>

<p>The <i>œsophagus</i> carries the food from the
mouth and passing down the neck beside
the windpipe opens into—</p>

<p>The <i>crop</i>, where the food is macerated.
Thence it gradually passes into—

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>The <i>true stomach</i> (or proventriculus),
which is lined with small gastric-secreting
glands that may be seen with the naked eye.
This organ is hidden by the liver, and opens
directly into—</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i117" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img src="images/i117.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION NO. 4<br />
Lungs, kidneys, etc., in situ.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>gizzard</i>, situated on the left side of
the abdomen. It rests on the coiled-up mass
of intestines. It is dark red and is partly
hidden by the left lobe of the liver. The
walls are strong and muscular. Here the
food is ground against small bits of stone,
etc. The partially digested food passes out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
through an aperture near the entrance of the
true stomach into—</p>

<p>The <i>duodenum</i> or upper portion of the
small intestine. It forms a loop that incloses—</p>

<p>The <i>pancreas</i>, a compact, flattened organ,
pinkish in color, that discharges its secretion
by three ducts into the intestines.</p>

<p>The <i>small intestine</i>, after forming the
loop (duodenum), continues its course. It
first passes toward the left and is disposed
in many folds connected by the mesentery;
toward the end it passes up behind the true
stomach. Connected to the intestines are
the blind bodies known as—</p>

<p>The <i>cæca</i>, connected to the small intestines
for several inches and which, after
becoming considerably smaller in diameter,
enter the alimentary tract where—</p>

<p>The <i>large intestine</i> (rectum) starts. This
portion of the intestines is short and enters—</p>

<p>The <i>cloaca</i>, into which the urinary and
reproductive ducts discharge. The external
opening is known as the <i>vent</i> or <i>anus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>brain</i>, situated in the back of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
head, is protected by the cranial bones. It
is milky white except where the blood vessels
may be seen.</p>

<p>The <i>windpipe</i> connects the larynx at the
throat with the lungs branching into the two
<i>bronchi</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>lungs</i>, situated in the upper portion
of the thoracic abdominal cavity, are firmly
attached to the ribs, in the interspaces between
which they fit. They are flattened
and oval in shape, bright red in color, and
loose and spongy in texture.</p>

<p>The <i>heart</i> is cone-shaped. The lower
portion rests between the lobes of the liver.
The heart is red and is inclosed in a sac
(the pericardium) that is easily removed.</p>

<p>The <i>liver</i>, situated a little lower down
than the heart, consists of two lobes. The
right lobe is often larger than the left which
may be cleft at the lower end. The left
lobe covers the true stomach and part of the
gizzard. If there is some delay in holding
a post-mortem examination the edges of the
lobes of the liver become discolored. Normally
the color is a purplish red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>The <i>gall bladder</i> fits into a shallow depression
on the underside of the right lobe
of the liver and appears green in color. A
duct conveys the bile from the liver into the
gall bladder, whence it passes by another
duct into the intestine.</p>

<p>The <i>spleen</i>, a nearly round, reddish body,
with a purplish tinge, is attached by a ligament
to the right side of the true stomach
and is hidden by the liver.</p>

<p>The <i>kidneys</i> extend along the sides of the
spine from immediately below the lungs to
near the termination of the abdominal
cavity. The general color is a chocolate
red, but a small portion at the upper end
(known as the adrenal), is yellow. There
is no urinary bladder. The urates are carried
direct through the <i>ureters</i> to the cloaca.</p>

<p>The <i>testes</i> (of the male bird) are attached
to the upper portion of the kidneys. They
are white or very light-colored, and may be
of different sizes.</p>

<p>The <i>ovary</i> (of the female bird), situated
on the left side, covers the kidney on that
side. It consists of numerous ova of vari<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>ous
sizes each of which may develop into
an egg. As an ovum passes through the
oviduct it is first coated with an albuminous
covering (the white of egg); lower down
it is coated with a calcareous deposit that
forms the shell of the egg. (Fig. 18.)</p>

<h3><i>3. Diagnosis of Disease by Post-Mortem
Symptoms</i></h3>

<p>For purposes of diagnosis each organ
must be examined. Note in each case if it
is enlarged, spotted, ruptured, inflamed or
engorged with blood. Observe if it is an
unusual color or if it possesses any other
symptom of an abnormal character.</p>

<p>A single symptom in a single organ, unless
very pronounced and characteristic,
will not be sufficient evidence for forming
an accurate opinion as to the cause of death.
But if the condition of the other organs and
the symptoms before and attending death
are taken into consideration, there will seldom
be any difficulty, from a practical
standpoint, in deciding upon the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the disease. Many points can be decided
only by a pathologist with the aid of a microscope,
such, for example, as the difference
between coccidial and bacterial diarrhea,
but it is quite enough for the poultryman to
realize that one of his fowls has died of an
attack of an acute form of diarrhea and that
the rest of his birds may become infected.</p>

<p>The following notes draw attention to the
main diagnostic symptoms observable on
post-mortem examination, arranged under
the heading of the organs affected. Other
symptoms are put in parentheses.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Post-Mortem Symptoms</span></p>

<h3>BRAIN</h3>

<p><i>Apoplexy.</i>—Shown by congestion of
blood vessels of brain. (Staggering gait
and sudden death.)</p>

<h3>HEART</h3>

<p><i>Cholera.</i>—Punctiform hemorrhages are
generally found in the heart in cases of
cholera. (Yellow feces; diarrhea; sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
death of several or many fowls; inflammation
of upper portion of intestines.)</p>

<h3>LIVER</h3>

<p><i>Tuberculosis.</i>—Yellowish-white spots on
liver varying in size, somewhat <i>raised</i> and
convex; the spots or nodules may be readily
separated from the rest of the liver. The
liver itself is often very much enlarged.
(Fowl gradually loses weight and may go
lame; mesentery and spleen affected with
nodules.)</p>

<p><i>Cholera.</i>—Liver enlarged, dark green
and softened, sometimes showing whitish
spots.</p>

<p><i>Coccidial diarrhea.</i>—More or less circular
patches, depressed in the centre, associated
with plugged cæca, the linings of
which have sores.</p>

<p><i>Congested liver.</i>—Much enlarged and engorged
with blood, may be readily torn.</p>

<p><i>Fatty degeneration or fatty liver.</i>—In the
first case the liver is rather shrunken and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
hardened, and in the latter excessive deposits
of fat may be noticed.</p>

<p><i>Liver trouble.</i>—(Indigestion.) An enlarged
liver without any of the special
symptoms noted among the other diseases
of the liver.</p>

<p><i>Gout.</i>—Needle-like crystals (urate of
soda) give the liver the appearance of having
been covered with chalk. (Other organs
in abdominal cavity covered with
same powder-like crystals.)</p>

<p><i>Aspergillosis.</i>—Necrotic areas with
mold. (Fowls go light and move about in
a depressed manner, resting on their breast
bones.)</p>

<h3>STOMACH</h3>

<p><i>Gastritis.</i>—The mucous membrane lining
of the stomach is reddened and inflamed.</p>

<h3>INTESTINES</h3>

<p><i>Diarrhea.</i>—Acute forms of intestinal
troubles give rise to inflammation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
mucous membrane lining the walls of the
intestines.</p>

<p><i>Cholera.</i>—The upper portion of the intestines
may be reddened and the contents
show streaks or clots of blood.</p>

<p><i>Worms.</i>—Round or tape worms present
in intestines.</p>

<h3>CÆCA</h3>

<p>These blind ducts are of importance in
showing the presence of coccidiosis in fowls
or blackhead in turkeys.</p>

of the future must be based upon more rational practices
than those which have been followed in the past. We
have felt for some time that there was a place for a
brief, and at the same time comprehensive, treatise on
this important subject of Soil Fertility. Professor Vivian’s
experience as a teacher in the short winter courses has
admirably fitted him to present this matter in a popular
style. In this little book he has given the gist of the
subject in plain language, practically devoid of technical
and scientific terms. It is pre-eminently a “First Book,”
and will be found especially valuable to those who desire
an introduction to the subject, and who intend to do subsequent
reading. Illustrated. 5 x 7 inches. 265 pages. Cloth.</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Clarence A. Shamel</span>. This book covers fully the
principles of breeding and feeding for both fat stock and
dairying type. It tells of sheep and mutton raising, hot

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
